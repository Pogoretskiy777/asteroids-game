# A.S.T.E.R.O.I.D.S

## Introduction

A.S.T.E.R.O.I.D.S is an Atari-inspired shooter game where the player needs to destroy as many rocks and aliens as possible. This project's guidelines were set by [Dr. Isaac Wang](https://www.isaacdwang.com) from James Madison University for CS159 (Advanced Programming) in the Spring semester of 2023. This project was designed to gain experience with object-oriented programming, Java libraries, and GUI implementation.
